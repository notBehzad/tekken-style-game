2D Fighting Game (CPP, SFML)

Due to short deadline, the animation of character 3 and 4 is not implemented. Only the PNGs are to be cropped and named, every other work for these charcter is already done.
The config file defines the player stats. Stats can be changed from there.
The time history log is not implemented on SFML but you can see it on console.

The Game is not tested properly, it was just an ordinary assignment to enhance my knowledge about how the game works on low level.
